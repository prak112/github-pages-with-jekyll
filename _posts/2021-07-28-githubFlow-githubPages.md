## **GitHub Flow**
    
    
    Development of an idea or a project through GitHub involves the following -
      1. Create a repository
      2. Update README.md
      3. Build the project along the master/main branch
    
    If a collaborator/yourself has a feature suggestion/bug correction for the project, then the following applies -
      1. Open a new branch entitled with feature/bug
      2. Commit changes to the branch
      3. Create/Open a Pull Request
      4. Review Pull Request and suggest/apply correction if needed
      5. Post-Review, Merge feature/bug branch to master branch
    
## **GitHub Pages**
    
    
    The developed project can be deployed as a website, considering we have the required information in the following files -
      1. INDEX.md or README.md -
            information regarding the project being published
      2. _CONFIG.yml -
            settings such as theme, author, title, brief description, social network handles.
      3. _POSTS/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md -
            the _POSTS folder consists of the blog posts with timestamp & title, either as a .md or .html file
